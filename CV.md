Initially I was drawn to programming as a powerful tool for mathematics and data analytics. Later I fell in love with programming when I realized the uninhibited creative freedom I had to create anything I wanted with just my computer & my mind. This love for my craft drives me to always keep learning, adapting and perfecting my skills. I want to use my skills to write elegant and beautiful code that will contribute to meaningful projects and help build amazing things.
